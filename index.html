        <h4>Q: How does javascript works?</h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Ans: javascript is a single-threaded programming language. that means
          javascript can only execute one command at a time. It's also a
          synchronous single-threaded programming language which means that it
          will execute one command at a time in a specific order. that means it
          will only go to the next line when the current line finish executed.
          It's a high-level language. which means it's kind of far away from the
          machine language or assembly language. When we write JavaScript code
          and the browser receives the code, the computer cannot understand our
          JavaScript code directly, so the browser converts our code into
          machine language. And the role-play of that conversion is the engine
          of the browser and the name of that engine in Google Chrome is the V8
          engine. And in firefox, the name of that engine is the spider monkey.
          The different browser has their own different engine. A popular
          example of a JavaScript Engine is Googleâ€™s V8 engine. The V8 engine is
          used inside Chrome and Node.js also. Then engine compiles the code and
          sends it to us as output and we see our expected result in our
          computer.

        <h4>
          Q: What is the difference between local storage and session storage??
        </h4>
        <p class="lead">
          Ans: In javascript there is a big difference between local storage and
          session storage. Local storage keeps our data permanently. which means
          it will remain in our browser until we delete it from our browser.
          let's say we chose a product and make it our wishlist or added in our
          cart, now if we close our browser and we want to check again about our
          selected product it will remain as it is even if we come for the check
          after a month or year later. and session storage is for storing our
          data for a limited certain time. if we close our tab or browser it
          will remove. we will lose our data from session storage.
        </p>
        <p class="lead">
          So we can say local storage doesn't have expiry date we never gets
          lost our data even the user load immiediately or visit again after
          closing browser. and session storage keeps data for a session we will
          lose data after reloading or closing the browser.
